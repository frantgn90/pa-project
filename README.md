#PA Processor Project
====================

In this project we are developing our own scalar pipelined processor based on the MIPS architecture.

## Features

- [x] Fully Pipelined
- [x] Varaible Length Pipeline
- [x] Hazard Control
- [x] MIPS friendly, high compatibility (except for sll instruction)
- [x] ICache and DCache
- [ ] Store Buffer
- [ ] ROB or HF
- [ ] Virtual Memory
- [ ] Branch Prediction
- [ ] Out-of-Order
